# Student grader

Simple `C++` project for practice

## What it does

- Reads student information (name, number, scores)
- Calculates total, average scores for each
- Assign grades them from A to F
- Reorders students by grade
- Prints the results to the terminal and outputs a JSON file

---

## TODO List

- [x] Read file
- [x] Calculate total, average
- [ ] Assign grades
- [ ] Sort by score
- [ ] Save output as JSON
- [ ] Draw a flow chart
- [ ] Split major logic into separate files

## Build and Run

Compile with `g++`:

> Create `build` directory first

```sh
g++ ./src/main.cpp -o ./build/main.exe
```

Run the executable:

```sh
./build/main.exe
```
